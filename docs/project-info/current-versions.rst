Current Versions
================

Since *spray* heavily depends on Akka_ its releases are usually closely tied to specific Akka versions.


0.9.0
-----

This version targets Scala 2.9.x and Akka 1.3.x and is therefore not recommended for new projects anymore.
Its documentation doesn't live here but in the (old) `github wiki`_.


1.0/1.1/1.2
-----------

Since the Scala universe has shifted from Scala 2.9 to Scala 2.10 the next *spray* release is a triple release,
targeting both Scala and three Akka versions at the same time.

Currently the first release candidate for *spray* 1.0/1.1/1.2 is available, please choose |1.0|, |1.1| or
|1.2| depending on what Scala/Akka version you are targeting.

Nightly Builds
--------------

If you'd like to have access to the most recent changes and additions without having to build *spray* yourself you can
rely on the nightly builds, which we are currently publishing for the `release/1.0`_, `release/1.1`_ and `release/1.2`_
branches of the *spray* repository. Every day shortly past midnight UTC a new build is made available unless the
respective branch has not seen any new commits since the last build.

In order to help you identify the exact commit from which a build is cut every artifact directory includes a
``commit-<version>.html`` file containing the commit hash with a link to the commit on github.

Nightly builds are available from the http://nightlies.spray.io repository.
