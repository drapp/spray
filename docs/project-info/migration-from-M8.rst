Migration from M8
=================

Big breaking changes
--------------------

_`Replacement of HttpBody by HttpData`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``HttpBody`` was completely replaced by ``HttpData``. ``HttpData`` is a data structure that
abstracts over either ``ByteString`` buffers (``HttpData.Bytes``), data from files
(``HttpData.FileBytes``), and combinations of both (``HttpData.Compound``). This allows spray-can
to combine both heap byte buffers and data from files without ever having to load file data into a
heap buffer.
The companion object of ``HttpEntity`` contains lots of overloaded apply methods to create an
``HttpEntity`` without having to deal with ``HttpData`` directly.

_`Authentication`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication rejections were remodelled. There's now only one rejection type, ``AuthenticationFailedRejection``, that
contains a cause (``CredentialsMissing`` or ``CredentialsRejected``) and a list of headers to add to the response
as a challenge for the client. Previously, challenge generation wasn't handled uniformly and challenges weren't generated
at all in some cases. For your custom authenticator, you now have to generate the challenge headers directly in
the ``ContextAuthenticator`` implementation. ``HttpAuthenticator`` now has a new abstract method to implement to return
challenge headers.

_`Chunking support`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With request chunk aggregation turned off (``spray.can.server.request-chunk-aggregation-limit = 0``)
spray-can will deliver request chunks as is to the user-level handler.
Previously, all chunks of a request came in subsequently without any interaction needed from the handler. Now the
``ChunkedRequestStart`` message has to be acknowledged with a ``RegisterChunkHandler`` message which contains the
ActorRef of an actor to handle the chunks before any actual ``MessageChunks`` will be delivered. This allows to
separate the handling of multiple incoming request chunk streams to several chunk handlers.


_`(Un)marshalling`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(TODO)

 - Introduction of ToResponseMarshaller etc.
 - RequestContext.complete overloads gone
 - CompletionMagnet gone


Comprehensive list of breaking changes
--------------------------------------

The following list is an annotated version of all commits that were marked as breaking (``!``) since M8. You may
find additional information on how to fix broken code by looking into the linked commits. Changes are often accompanied
with test changes that show how code can be fixed.

spray-cache
~~~~~~~~~~~

 - ExpiringLruCache uses ``Duration`` instead of ``Long`` for timeouts [2394720]_.
 - ``LruCache.apply`` doesn't allow ``Duration.Zero`` any more but ``Duration.Inf``, instead, for not specifying
   any timeout [2394720]_.

.. [2394720] `use util.Timestamp in ExpiringLruCache <http://github.com/spray/spray/commit/2394720>`_

spray-can
~~~~~~~~~

Server-side changes:

 - Http handlers must answer ``ChunkedRequestStart`` message with ``RegisterChunkHandler`` command
   (see `chunking support`_) [d738e54]_
 - ``ServerSettings`` timeout settings were moved into a separate class [9193318]_.


Client-side changes:

 - new member ``HostConnectorSettings.maxRedirects`` to enable automatic redirection handling on the client side
   [98365ff]_
 - ``spray.can.client.user-agent-header`` vs. specifying a custom ``User-Agent`` header behavior changed: a custom
   ``User-Agent`` header now always overrides any configuration setting. The setting is used when there's no custom
   header specified [6fec00c]_.
 - Connection failure and request timeout now produce dedicated exceptions on the client side [4b48875]_.
 - ``HostConnectorSettings.connectionSettings`` are now read from ``spray.can.client`` instead of from
   ``spray.can.host-connector.client`` [9abbcf6]_.
 - ``spray.can.client.ssl-encryption`` is gone. Instead, ``Http.Connect`` got a new ``sslEncryption`` parameter
   replacing the global setting. [e922cd4]_.
 - ``HostConnectorSetup`` must now be created from hostname and port. Before it was created from an ``InetSocketAddress``
   which wasn't enough to distinguish virtual hosts [a47f3b0]_.

Other changes:

 - ``keepOpenOnPeerClosed`` is not supported for Http and was removed from ``Http.Register`` [f6b0292]_.
 - ``ClientConnectionSettings`` and ``ServerSettings`` got a new member ``maxEncryptionChunkSize`` [0b5ef36]_.
 - Lots of formerly public types belonging to spray's private API were marked as such [da29cdf]_.
 - ``spray.can.server.response-size-hint`` was adapted to ``spray.can.server.response-header-size-hint``. The same
   for ``spray.can.client.request-size-hint`` [ba1ae77]_.
 - ``Content-Length.length`` is now a ``Long`` value. Also ``spray.can.server.parsing.max-content-length`` and
   ``incoming-auto-chunking-threshold-size`` [b2fee8d]_.
 - ``SetIdleTimeout`` command now always resets the timeout [ab17f00]_.
 - ``SslTlsSupport`` pipeline stage now publishes a ``SSLSessionEstablished`` event with session details [80982d4]_.
 - New ``ParserSettings.sslSessionInfoHeader`` setting which enables the automatic addition of a synthetic
   ``SSL-Session-Info`` header to a request/response with SSL session information [e486900]_.

spray-http
~~~~~~~~~~

 - ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` and ``Origin`` header models now have members of newly introduced type ``HttpOrigin``
   instead of the previous ``Uri`` which didn't completely match the model [015f3c6]_.
 - ``Renderer.seqRenderer`` and related signatures changed [e058a43]_.
 - in ``Uri.Query`` a ``'='`` is rendered even for empty values unless the special value ``Query.EmptyValue`` is used.
   Also, a query parsed from ``?key=`` will now be rendered the same way (previously,  a trailing ``'='`` was always stripped) [d2b8bba]_.
 - ``(Multipart)FormData.fields`` are now represented as ``Seq`` to be able to model duplicate fields [ad593d1]_.
 - ``HttpMessage.entityAccepted`` was renamed to ``HttpMessage.isEntityAccepted`` [5d78dae]_.
 - `Replacement of HttpBody by HttpData`_ [c6f49cc]_.
 - Many charsets in ``HttpCharsets`` are not any more available as static values. Use
   ``HttpCharset.getForKey("windows-1252")`` to access a particular charset [f625b5a]_.
 - ``Uri.Query.apply`` and ``Uri.Host.apply`` have a new ``charset`` parameter [88a25f7]_.
 - ``Uri.Query`` has a new subtype ``Uri.Query.Raw`` which will be generated when parsing with mode
   ``Uri.ParsingMode.RelaxedWithRawQuery`` [d8a9ee4]_.
 - ``MediaRanges.custom`` was renamed to ``MediaRange.custom`` [a915b8f]_.
 - ``HttpSuccess`` and ``HttpFailure`` are not public API any more. Use ``StatusCode.isSuccess`` instead [a9e0d2c]_.

spray-routing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - ``RequestContext.complete`` overloads were removed in favor of using the marshalling infrastructure
   (see `(Un)marshalling`) [4d787dc]_.
 - ``Slash_!`` is gone and ``Slash`` got its semantics. ``PathEnd`` now just matches the end of the path.
   ``PathDirectives`` were adapted to have the same semantics as before [1480e73]_.
 - ``CompletionMagnet`` is gone in favor of the new ``ToResponseMarshaller`` infrastructure [7a36de5]_.
 - ``FieldDefMagnetAux``, ``ParamDefMagnetAux``, and ``AnyParamDefMagnetAux`` are gone and replaced by a simpler
   construct [d86cb80]_.
 - ``RequestContext.marshallingContext`` is gone. ``produce`` directive loses its ``status`` and ``header`` parameter
   which can be replaced by using an appropriate ``ToResponseMarshaller`` [b145ced]_.
 - ``AuthenticationFailedRejection`` now directly contains challenge headers to return. There's no need to implement
   a (fake) ``HttpAuthenticator`` to make use of the rejection (see `Authentication`_) [9c9b976]_.
 - ``FileAndResourceDirectives.withTrailingSlash`` and ``fileSystemPath`` are now private [ab35761]_.
 - ``decompressRequest`` and ``compressResponse`` now always need parentheses. Also, encoding directives like the
   ``compressResponse`` automatically use the ``autoChunkFileBytes`` directives to avoid having to load potentially huge
   files into memory [e3defb4]_.
 - ``(h)require`` directives can now take several rejections instead of an Option of only one [9c11228]_.
 - ``detachTo`` is gone in favor of ``detach()`` which always needs parentheses. The underlying implementation is now
   Future-based and needs an (implicit or explicit) ``ExecutionContext`` or ``ActorRefFactory`` in scope [ead4a70]_.
 - ``PathMatcher.(flat)Map`` were renamed to ``PathMatcher.h(flat)Map``. ``map`` and ``flatMap`` were reintroduced for
   ``PathMatcher1`` instances [8c91851]_.
 - ``AuthenticationFailedRejection`` and ``AuthenticationRequiredRejection`` were merged and
   remodelled. [034779d]_
 - ``PathMatchers.Empty`` was renamed to ``PathMatchers.Neutral`` [ee7fe47]_.
 - ``UserPassAuthenticator.cached`` was renamed to ``CachedUserPassAuthenticator.apply`` [1326046]_.
 - ``PathMatcher.apply`` now takes a ``Path`` prefix instead of a ``String`` [3ff3471]_.
