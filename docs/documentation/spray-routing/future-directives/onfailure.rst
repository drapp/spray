onFailure
=========

"Unwraps" a ``Future[T]`` and runs its inner route when the future has failed
with the future's failure exception as an extraction of type ``Throwable``.

Signature
---------

.. includecode:: /../spray-routing/src/main/scala/spray/routing/directives/FutureDirectives.scala
   :snippet: onFailure

Description
-----------

The execution of the inner route passed to a onFailure directive is deferred until the given future
has completed with a failure, exposing the reason of failure as a extraction of type ``Throwable``.
If the future succeeds the request is completed using the values marshaller (this directive therefore
requires a marshaller for the future's type to be implicitly available).

It is necessary to bring a ``ExecutionContext`` into implicit scope for this directive to work.
