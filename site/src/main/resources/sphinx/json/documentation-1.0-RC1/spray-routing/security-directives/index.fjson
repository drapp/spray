This may be done with a username/password combination, a cookie, a pre-defined IP or some\nother mechanism. After authentication the system believes that it knows who the user is.</p>\n<p><em>Authorization</em> is the process of determining, whether a given user is allowed access to a given resource or not. In\nmost cases, in order to be able to authorize a user (i.e. allow access to some part of the system) the users identity\nmust already have been established, i.e. he/she must have been authenticated. Without prior authentication the\nauthorization would have to be very crude, e.g. &#8220;allow access for <em>all</em> users&#8221; or &#8220;allow access for <em>noone</em>&#8221;. Only after\nauthentication will it be possible to, e.g., &#8220;allow access to the statistics resource for _admins_, but not for regular\n<em>members</em>&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Authentication and authorization may happen at the same time, e.g. when everyone who can properly be authenticated is\nalso allowed access (which is often a very simple and somewhat implicit authorization logic). In other cases the\nsystem might have one mechanism for authentication (e.g. establishing user identity via an LDAP lookup) and another one\nfor authorization (e.g. a database lookup for retrieving user access rights).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "display_toc": true, "title": "SecurityDirectives", "sourcename": "", "customsidebar": null, "current_page_name": "documentation/spray-routing/security-directives/index", "next": {"link": "authenticate/", "title": "authenticate"}, "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["documentation/spray-routing/security-directives/authenticate", "authenticate", "N", "next"], ["documentation/spray-routing/scheme-directives/schemeName", "schemeName", "P", "previous"]], "meta": {}, "parents": [{"link": "../../", "title": "Documentation"}, {"link": "../", "title": "spray-routing"}, {"link": "../predefined-directives-by-trait/", "title": "Predefined Directives (by trait)"}], "sidebars": null, "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">SecurityDirectives</a><ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#authentication-vs-authorization\">Authentication vs. Authorization</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "prev": {"link": "../scheme-directives/schemeName/", "title": "schemeName"}, "metatags": ""}
